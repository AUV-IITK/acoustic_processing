# acoustic_processing

This repository is aimed at making the acoustic localisation system work for Anahita.

Steps to compile the code presently:

1. Install fftw from their website. Then try to make.
2. Unusual linting bug in Eigen Vectors library. I don't know how relevant it is to us. But I fixed it and moved on.
